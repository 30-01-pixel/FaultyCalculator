# Faulty Calculator

A responsive calculator with a twist - it sometimes performs the wrong operations!

## Features

- Basic calculator operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clean, responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Keyboard support for easy input
- 10% of the time, it performs the wrong operation according to these rules:
  - Addition (+) becomes Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*) becomes Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-) becomes Division (/)
  - Division (/) becomes Exponentiation (**)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Use the calculator like a normal calculator
3. Be prepared for occasional surprise results!

## Technologies Used

- 
- CSS3 (with responsivHTML5e design using media queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)

## Note

This project was created to demonstrate how to intentionally implement "faulty" behavior in a program while maintaining a clean user interface.
